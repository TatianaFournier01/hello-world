Hello world, my name is Tatiana, I'm from Quebec City, Canada. 
Tomorrow (ocotober 26th) I am about to start my coding journey. I've had already done an introduction class this summer, but this time I am about to dive more in depht into it. 
I thought that I would be nervous, but I am actually thrilled and ready to start. I do not know where this journey will lead me, but I am confident and willing to trust the process.
